# Prework Study Guide Webpage For Coding Bootcamp

## Description



- The motivation for this project was to create a study guide for ASU coding bootcamp students so we could have easy access to terminology all on a single webpage
- I built this project to organize the information given in earlier moduels so its easy to read and study. 
- The problem was information overload. Starting this class with no prior experience is challenging, and having an organized study guide to easily access is helpful.
- I learned elements, commands and structure in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and how they work with one another. I also learned how to develope a growth mindset.

- Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. to Open Chrome DevTools for (macOS) press Command+Option+I for (Windows) press Control+Shift+I. or right click anywhere in the browser and select 'inspect' from the dropdown menue. Make sure your default browser is set to google chrome. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
